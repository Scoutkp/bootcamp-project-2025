            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Scout Knight-Pheng (he/him). I am from Long Beach, California and I'm a 1st year Computer Science major. Fun fact, know how to juggle 3 balls and I love magic and puzzles. I joined the triathlon team this year since I love mountain biking and swimming. I also like to play video games, watch action/mystery shows, and recently beat Hollow Knight.</p>
